# Drew's Dev Blog

This is the code for my dev blog.

It's based on [Astro Micro](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-micro/) with some modifications to the styling, plugins, etc.

## Getting started

Install the latest Node LTS (e.g. via nvm). Then:

```shell
# To run dev environment
npm run dev

# To build site to static 'dist' folder.
npm run build

# To format code
npm run format

# To check / lint code
npm run check
npm run lint
```
